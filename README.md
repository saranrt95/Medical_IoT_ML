# Medical_IoT_ML
A repository of datasets from medical Internet of things devices for use in machine learning classification.

These datasets have been created and analysed via eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods for the experiments carried out in the paper E. Cambiaso, S. Narteni, I. Baiardini, F. Braido, A. Paglialonga, and M. Mongelli "Advancements on IoT and AI applied to Pneumology" (November 2023), under submission to Elsevier-Microprocessors and Microsystems journal

# Smartwatch data

The file "FinalData_20221014_demoHealthcom.xlsx" collects 1 month of cardiorespiratory and activity daily measurements from a volunteer subject undergoing a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease treatment. 

The goal is to train a rule-based classifier able to predict the treatment dose class, expressed by the binary label `therapy = 1' (1 puff/day) or  `therapy = 2' (2 puffs/day), through the available inputs.
